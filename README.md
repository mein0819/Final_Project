# Final Project

## Goals
The topic we chose concerns trends in the value of homes in the United States and their correlation with rent prices. The question we hope to answer is how rent prices in major metropolitan cities in the United States are affected by home value.

## Overview
To that end, we sourced and analyzed data from [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/). For example, one of the datasets used in our exploratory analysis is the Zillow Home Value Index dataset (HVI), measures the typical home value in a metropolitcan area in the U.S.

For our exploratory analysis of the data, we used the following resources:
- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- PostgreSQL
- pgAdmin

### Communication and collaboration
Our team elected to maintain communication through Slack and setting up times to meet over Zoom, coordinating around each other's schedules and taking advantage of breakout rooms during class time and office hours to meet and talk through the project. 

## Database
The inital database setup included cleaning the datasets and sampling the data within to create the rudimentary data structure, which could then be read into the machine learning model. 

## Machine Learning
For this first segment, the machine learning model chosen was a linear regression model. The model took data from the provisional database to conduct some initial tests.
