# Final Project

## Presentation
The topic we chose concerns trends in the value of homes in the United States and their correlation with rent prices. We chose our topic because it is extremely relevant amidst rising rent prices and an ongoing housing crisis in the United States. Our team is personally invested in this topic as citizens and consumers in the housing market. The outcome of the data analysis can help inform our understanding of the market and encourage research into other factors affecting rent prices using the information from our analysis.

## Goals
The question we hope to answer is how rent prices in major metropolitan cities in the United States are affected by home value by analyzing the correlations between various measurements of home value.

## Overview
To that end, we sourced and analyzed data from [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/). For example, one of the datasets used in our exploratory analysis is the Zillow Home Value Index dataset (HVI), measures the typical home value in a metropolitcan area in the U.S.

We have employed the following resources for our project:
- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- PostgreSQL
- pgAdmin
- Amazon Web Services
- Tableau

### Communication and collaboration
Our team elected to maintain communication through Slack and setting up times to meet over Zoom, coordinating around each other's schedules and taking advantage of breakout rooms during class time and office hours to meet and talk through the project. 

## Database
This segment started with working in ERD, finding connections between tables. We later took some research as joining multiple different columns on four different tables was a new adventure. We used SQL in pgAdmin to execute this code that was connected to our AWS server that all team members have access to in order to better collaborate on our project.
